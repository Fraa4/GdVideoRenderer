# GdVideoRenderer
A program that renders a video inside Geometry Dash

GdVideoRenderer Version 1.1 by Fra4
This program lets you render a video/gif in GD, keep in mind this is resource heavy and it will use a lot of objects in the level itself
This is still a Demo and i will keep trying to optimize it.

CREATE A NEW EMPTY LEVEL BEFORE EXECUTING THE FILE, if you don't do it this will overwrite everything in that level, it is also recommended to create a backup/save progress just to be sure.
